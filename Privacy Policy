Welcome to SafeWallet!

Your privacy is critically important to us. At SafeWallet, we have a few fundamental principles:

We do not actively collect personal information about you when you use our mobile application.
We do not store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of our services.
We aim to make it as simple as possible for you to manage what information on your device is shared and permanently deleted.
1. Information We Do Not Collect
SafeWallet is designed to store your credit and debit card information locally on your device. We do not collect any information from your use of our application. There is no account creation that would link any data to your identity, nor is there any data transmitted off your device that is related to your card information.

2. Local Storage
The SafeWallet app stores all your data locally on your device. We do not have the ability to access any of the information you store within the SafeWallet app.

3. Security
We strive to protect the information you store on your device. SafeWallet uses industry-standard security measures to ensure the safety of your card data at all times. However, remember that no method of electronic storage is 100% secure.

4. Changes to Privacy Policy
Although most changes are likely to be minor, SafeWallet may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in SafeWalletâ€™s sole discretion. We encourage users to frequently check this page for any changes to the Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this app after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.

By using SafeWallet, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.
